No because we already declared num1 using the keyword const which does not allow us to reasign the value.

//! if you look at the html you'll notice the form has a name attribute
//! associated with the inputs
const firstNumber = document.getElementsByName("firstNum")[0]
const secondNumber = document.getElementsByName("secondNum")[0]

//* Here we create a function that adds the value of two input fields
//* created in the HTML
//! Note: These input fields are ALWAYS considered as text in HTML even
//! if it is a number, therefore we parse our input field into an integer
//! in order to add

//* the addEventListener function takes in two arguments, one is the 
//* type of event, and the second is the function we want to call when the
//* event is triggered
numbersForm.addEventListener('submit', onSubmit)


//! If you notice the inputs in the form also have an id associated with
//! it
//? Comment out firstNumber and SecondNumber
//? Now instead of getElementsByName try getting the element by its id
